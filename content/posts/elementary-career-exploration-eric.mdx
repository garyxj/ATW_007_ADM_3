# Abstract

Career development is a lifelong process that begins in childhood and has been linked to student success in other aspects of their development in childhood and adulthood (Blackhurst, Auger, & Wahl, 2003). This article presents a fifth-grade technology-based career development curriculum that engages students in a 10-week long exploration of interests, skills, college degrees and careers, and culminates with students creating career trifold display boards and presenting them to community members. School counselors can use this career exploration unit to support students’ career development and to begin the lifelong process of preparing them for success in the world of work.

# Elementary Career Development

Career development refers to the impact of psychological and behavioral processes such as decision‑making styles, expression of values, interests, skills, integration of life‑roles, and self‑concepts, as well as contextual influences in shaping an individual’s career over their life span (Niles & Harris‑Bowlsbey, 2013).

Gottfredson’s theory of circumscription and compromise describes how individuals form career aspirations, often eliminating options by the end of elementary school based on gender, academic ability, social prestige, personal interest, and beliefs on attainability (Gottfredson, 1981, 2005).

Super’s life‑span, life‑space theory situates elementary students in the “growth” phase, characterized by desire for information, exploration of self and world, acquiring career information, and developing awareness of likes/dislikes—building a foundation for future development (Super, 1980).

Ginzberg’s developmental perspective emphasizes tentative choices beginning around fifth grade, with children making choices based on interests, skills, and values (Ginzberg, 1951).

# Empirical Support

Meta‑analyses show elementary students benefit academically when career interventions are integrated with academic subject matter and are sustained (Evans & Burck, 1992; Baker & Taylor, 1998). Students begin forming coherent career aspiration structures (Trice et al., 1995), yet need support to link general preparation requirements to specific careers (Blackhurst et al., 2003).

# School Counselor Leadership

School counselors can lead developmentally appropriate career programs aligned to the ASCA National Model and ASCA Mindsets & Behaviors for Student Success, collaborating to integrate career learning across domains and classes.

# Career Exploration Unit (10 Weeks)

## Lesson 1 – Introduction

Overview the unit, calendar of events, and a mock‑up of the final trifold display board. Send parent packets to engage families early.

## Lesson 2 – Multiple Intelligences

Introduce Gardner’s eight “smarts” using age‑appropriate labels (word, number, picture, body, music, people, self, nature smart). Students hypothesize their top three.

## Lesson 3 – Multiple Intelligences Survey

Students complete an online self‑assessment (e.g., Literacy Works) to identify dominant smarts and reflect on implications.

## Lesson 4 – Interests Exploration

Use Holland’s RIASEC framework; have students identify interest codes and brainstorm aligned activities and roles.

## Lesson 5 – Skills Identification

Students inventory current skills and connect them to classroom tasks and potential careers; introduce growth mindset for developing skills over time.

## Lesson 6 – Degrees & Pathways

Teach levels of postsecondary credentials (certificates, associate, bachelor’s, graduate), typical timelines, and example pathways tied to interests/skills.

## Lesson 7 – Career Research

Model reliable sources and note‑taking; students research one career’s duties, education, outlook, and daily activities.

## Lesson 8 – Trifold Planning

Storyboard sections: title, interest/skill match, education pathway, day‑in‑the‑life, visuals, and references.

## Lesson 9 – Build & Practice

Create display boards; rehearse presentations with peer feedback against a rubric.

## Lesson 10 – Community Career Fair

Students present to invited community members; collect feedback; reflect on learning and next steps.

# Evaluation & Outcomes

Include quick DOL checks per lesson to assess understanding and adjust instruction. Evidence shows increased engagement, attendance, and social‑emotional capacity when learning connects to real‑world goals.
