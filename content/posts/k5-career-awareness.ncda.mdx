There is much attention directed towards career planning for high school and middle school students. While high school students receive guidance and information from counselors, assessments and websites, elementary students are only beginning to become aware of how their schooling can be related to the world of work. There are some states and private entities that are creating career awareness materials and programs for elementary students, but it is not a nationwide endeavor. To set up students for success it is necessary to introduce them to career awareness in the elementary grades (Maia Learning, 2025).

**Why Start Career Awareness at the Elementary Level?**

Donald Super’s Theory of Career Development emphasizes the importance of self-concept in career choices. This theory includes five stages. The first stage is considered the Growth Stage (Childhood to Adolescence). During this stage, children are developing their self-concept based on their experiences and observations of their world. Super believed this stage is important because it can provide experiences that can help guide career choices later in life (Teachers Institute, 2023). While there are many ways that K-5 students can experience and observe career-related learning outside of the school setting, it is important there are also opportunities provided within the school setting that not only introduce students to careers but also aid parents in their roles in the student’s career development. “Providing early career exploration opportunities improve students’ academic performance and help them connect the dots between self-concept, education, and various career paths” (Yavuz, 2022, p. 47). Informing young students about career opportunities is an important step in their development. Educators and counselors can help them see the connection between their schooling and the world of work.

**What Does Career Awareness Look Like at the K-5 Level?**

Career awareness at the elementary level involves exposing children to various occupations, fostering an understanding of the skills needed for different jobs, and encouraging curiosity and exploration. Activities can include guest speakers, hands-on projects, field trips, and interactive lessons that highlight diverse career paths. Parents, teachers, and school counselors play a crucial role in facilitating these experiences by providing resources, sharing their own career journeys, and connecting students with professionals in the community.

Arizona, Delaware, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin are a few of the states that have invested money, time, and resources in developing websites to reflect their commitment to providing access to opportunities for parents, educators, and school counselors to learn more about career development for the K-5 population. The resources include activities, book lists, family guides, lesson plans, posters, standards, videos, and more.

- Arizona Career Awareness Grades K-5 — standards-based activities and skills.
- Delaware Career Resource Network — grade-level booklists, activities, family resources.
- Kentucky Department of Education — K–5 career studies standards and cluster resources.
- Ohio K-5 Elementary In Demand Jobs Toolkit — activities and guides.
- Virginia Career View — K–12 dashboards, guides, activities.
- Wisconsin Department of Education — presentation with research, rationale, and resources.

In addition to the list of resources provided, each state uses the 16 Career Clusters Framework as a guide to the multiple career opportunities available in the public and private sectors. The 16 Career Cluster Framework highlights the 16 sectors, and the various professions associated with each sector. Students can begin to see the pathways that lead to certain careers. This awareness may help children see the connections between their interests, schooling and choices available to them.

Online platforms have joined the movement by developing interactive courses, engaging games, and informative websites designed to spark curiosity and expand understanding of various career paths. Examples include project‑based learning modules and game‑like exploration tailored to K–5.

**Looking Ahead**

Initiating career awareness at the elementary level is not merely a beneficial supplement to education but a foundational step in a student's holistic development. By introducing children to a diverse array of professions, fostering self-concept, and explicitly connecting classroom learning to real-world applications, educators, parents, and school counselors empower the next generation.
